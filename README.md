# Adaptive Quiz APP

Adaptive quizzes are a type of assessment that adjusts to the skill level of the student, providing a more personalized learning experience. Adaptive learning may contribute to both improving student learning outcomes and increasing student motivation and engagement. The Adaptive Quiz activity enables a teacher to create tests that efficiently measure the takers' abilities.

## How it works

Adaptive testing is a system of testing that changes to meet the current level of the student and ongoing progress the student makes. Adaptive tests are comprised of questions selected from the question bank that are tagged with a score of their difficulty. The questions are chosen to match the estimated ability level of the current test-taker. If the test-taker succeeds on a question, a more challenging question is presented next. If the test-taker answers a question incorrectly, a less-challenging question is presented next. This allows for a more accurate model of the studentsâ€™ current level of attainment.
